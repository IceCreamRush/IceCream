# IceCreamRush
![Image](Screenshots/01.png)

IceCreamRush is a little game made by 4 developpers in 5 days in Unity. The game had a predefined theme, "Summer" which we had to take into account while making the game.  
A final constraint we had is that this game should be played on mobile.  
  
### Presentation

You play as a citizen of a small town during summer. It is very hot and you hear an ice cream truck far away. Your goal is to get to that truck before you are dehydrated.  
However, be careful of the obstacles you while find along the way. Cars are everywhere and their oil puddles as well, and let's not talk about the intense sunrays that look definitelty lethal to you...   
Good luck !
